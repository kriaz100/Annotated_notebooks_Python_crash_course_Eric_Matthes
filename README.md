# Python_crash_course_notebooks

Google Colab notebooks provide not only a highly interactive environment for learning python, you can also use compute resource for free. Although the scripts included are small, running them in colab notebooks is much more convenient that running .py files. Many machine learning workflows involve prototyping ML/DL models in notebooks. So as you learn python, getting used to working in colab and the cloud environment has its advantages.

Moreover, I have collected several scripts that fall under the same topic/chapter into one notebook. Every notebook lists the .py files it contains, so you dont loose track of things. This is done with a view to reduce the clutter and help you focus all your attention on learning. 

Each chapter has two notebooks: first note book contains programs discussed in the chapter, and the second notebook implements solutions to the exercises. Both notebook names refer to chapter number. Example: chapter_09_classes and chapter_09_Exercises
