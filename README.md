### See repo pcc2 - original python crash course notebooks

This repository offers annotated and consolidated Google Colab notebooks for the core chapters of "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. 

By consolidating several scripts that cover the same topic or chapter into a single notebook, this repository allows you to focus on learning without being overwhelmed by clutter. 

One of the main benefits of using Colab notebooks is the ability to access free compute resources. These notebooks provide a seamless and convenient environment for learning and prototyping Python, including machine learning and deep learning models. Using the colab to implement python scripts also teaches you how to leverage cloud computing resources that  would come in handy in your data science journey. 

In addition to helping you stay organized and focused on learning, the annotations in these notebooks can be useful for quickly reviewing the materials after you have read the book. The annotations offer concise descriptions of each code cell, allowing you to quickly refresh your knowledge without having to read through the entire chapter in the book. This makes the repository a valuable resource for quick revision of selected topics that you may want to refresh your understanding of.
